# Arithmetic Sequence 

Its a sequence or loop such as 1, 3, 5, 7. Difference between recursive formula and explicit formula is very simple. Recursive formula is local, which means you can only find the
value next to the known values, however it cannot find the values outside it. Explicit formula is global, meaning you can find any values.
